# Retrogram documentation
The starting point of retrogram docs/analysis

## Overview
Since the creation of smartphones (1994) people have dealt with a 2-D screen showing some frames. After many generations technology tends to 3-D screens or to be specific, visualizing objects in real life, like Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and the most charming, Hologram.
Using physics rules and math, a hologram can record an interference pattern that uses diffraction to reproduce a 3-D light field. Currently, hologram devices are sold at a high cost and using a lot of hardware extensions. Not all images can be visualized using most hologram devices.
By turning your smartphone into a hologram device, we are working on a new real hologram experience that anyone can have at an extremely low cost without a lot of hardware complications.
Retro-Device is a holographic device consisting of a screen, and a special-purpose operating system by us, Retro-OS, with Bluetooth and WiFi connection. With some physics rules and light field reflection upon using a special kind of plastic and glasses, any picture can be represented in our device.
